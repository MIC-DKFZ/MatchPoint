/** \mainpage MatchPoint - DKFZ registration platform
 * \image html matchpoint-logo.png
 * \n\n
 * \section intro Introduction
 *
 * Welcome to MatchPoint! \n\n
 * MatchPoint tackles problems which are not, or only insufficiently, handled by other known registration projects.
 * MatchPoint is a framework in its original meaning. It focuses on concepts and paradigms that form a frame which
 * eases the utilization of registration algorithms (own and external work) and their integration in arbitrary applications.\n
 * The concrete implementation of algorithmic components is not a focus of MatchPoint.
 * Topics addressed and facilitated by MatchPoint are inter alia
 * \li support of algorithm evaluation,
 * \li registration algorithms as services,
 * \li support of parallel data processing,
 * \li encapsulation of registration domain complexity and
 * \li intuitive, less error prone handling for none registration domain experts.

 * If you search for registration algorithms you should look at projects like <a href="http://elastix.isi.uu.nl">Elastix</a>,
 * <a href="http://www.itk.org">ITK</a>, <a href="http://plastimatch.org/">Plastimatch</a> ... .\n
 * If you search for framework that helps you to integrate these registration developments or others into your application, you are at the right place. ;)
